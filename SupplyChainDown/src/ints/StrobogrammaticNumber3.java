/**
 * A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).
 *
 * Write a function to count the total strobogrammatic numbers that exist in the range of low <= num <= high.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input: low = "50", high = "100"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 69, 88, and 96 are three strobogrammatic numbers.
 * Note:
 * Because the range might be a large number, the low and high numbers are represented as string.
